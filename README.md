Frontend and Backend technology:- 
Frontend Technology    Front-end web development, also known as client-side 
development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or 
Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge 
associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the 
front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be 
aware of how the field is developing. 
A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web 
technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, ), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as 
compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native). 
Backend Technology  The backend (or “server-side”) is the portion of the 
website you don’t see. It’s responsible for storing and organizing data, and 
ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. The backend 
communicates with the frontend, sending and receiving information to be 
displayed as a web page. Whenever you fill out a contact form, type in a web 
address, or make a purchase (any user interaction on the client-side), your 
browser sends a request to the server-side, which returns information in the 
form of frontend code that the browser can interpret and display. Our new site 
will need to have additional backend components to make it a dynamic web 
application—a website whose content can change based on what is in 
its database, and that can be modified by user input. This is distinct from a 
static website, which doesn’t require a database because its content generally 
stays the same.
